          <h2>My Background</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          After high school I was working in a manufacturing plant and my boss asked me to research computers, buy one and program it. I bought a computer, taught myself how to program and found I loved computers and programming!
          I went to college, got a degree in Computer Engineering and got a job in computer hardware engineering. I recently left my hardware engineering job and am excited to be getting back to programming.

          <h2>Why Web Programming?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          I paid my way through college programming production, scheduling, payroll, etc for a small manufacturing company. I found I <em>loved</em> programming and all the useful and creative things you can do with programming.
          The web has absolutely transformed what we can do and how we accomplish our goals. I'm <em>very</em> excited to get back to programming and be a part of this web innovation tidal wave!
